//Pseudocode for Fight Function

/*alert user of the fight between Spider-man and Batman

    set each fighters health to 100
    damage is determine by a random number no greater than 20

    after each round alert the use with

        the health of each fighter
        the round of the fight

    after each round each fighter inflicts damage upon the other

        set at a random number

    alert the user of the winner of the fight

        if both reach 0 health they both die
        else which ever fight has health greater than zero wins the fight.
